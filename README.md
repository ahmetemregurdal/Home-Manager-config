# HI
This is my daily-driver home-manager setup using flakes, I use NixOS but
decided to use home-manager standalone and here we are

# INSTALLATION
I don't think anyone should copy another dotfiles but instead get inspiration
from them but if you want to copy these, first refer to home-manager documentation
to install it and then clone this repo to .config/home-manager
